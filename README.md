## A Vigenère Cypher Breakery 

**By Kieran Redington**

###Overview
The aim of this program is to create a code breaker that can decode a 
Vigenere Cypher. It will be submitted as a project for GMIT distributed systems
module.  

How to use the program
Deploy the cracker.war file from the "Jar And War files" folder 
into the Tomcat server manager localhost:8080/manager

Run the viginere.jar file from the command line using the following command
java -cp ./viginere.jar ie.gmit.sw.vigenereBreakerImpl "..WarAndPeace.txt"


Using a key length of 5 and entering "GTBWULGJAWFLWVSKKAYFEWFL" the cypher
should return a decoded message "OBJECTORIENTEDASSIGNMENT"
